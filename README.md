CS-465 FullStack Development with MEAN

The travlr page was created both in an Angular project structure and an Express project structure. Express is a server-side framework that is focused on using Handlebar. Handlebars support creating partial page fragments, so it does not have to be coded on every page. Express also allows for rendered pages to be driven dynamically. I used Angular as well which provided more dynamic pages. The backend use a NoSQL database that works well with NodeJS making it a good use for the project.

This project used JSON to store data. It is easy to read and write, making it perfect to use with ease. JSON is used to exchange data to and from a server as well. JavaScript is a programming language that allows for dynamic and interactive webpages. 

Layers of security were added using encrypted passwords and hashes, protecting our data. Users were limited on things they could until logging in as well. Although you could view the trips, a trip could not be added, edited, or updated unless user was logged in.

This course was helpful in really seeing what the development process is like, and how many things come together. The use of MongoDB, Express, Angular, and NodeJS provided me with skills that will help in my future goals and career.
